  title: "FINDA DIDNT TRIGGER"
  text: "FINDA didn't trigger while loading filament. Ensure filament can move and FINDA works."
  action: [Retry]
  id: ""
  approved: false
  #suggestion1: add to the screen sensor state: FINDA (1/0), Fsensor (1/0)
  #suggestion2: test and verify the amount of action buttons needed ("repeat" might be enough)

   #suggestion1: add to the screen sensor state: FINDA (1/0), Fsensor (1/0)
  #suggestion2: Title is 21 characters. 2004A LCD could show just FSENSOR DIDNT TRIGG.  
  #(maybe a function that would substitute the 20th character with a dot in case there is over 20 characters in the title and there is only one 20chr line available on the LCD? so that the error definitions can stay the same for all the devices?)
